<h1> Email Scraping Lab </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was created for my capstone class that was required to complete my degree program. The goal of this program was to create a webscraper that would be able to scrape emails from multiple websites. The reason that I decided to go with making a python program from scratch instead of using another pre-made solution was because for our specific need, we needed to scrape emails from hundreds of different websites, so making a tool that was as universal as possible was the best solution. The program works by taking URLs from a .txt file and running them through the program and then it will spit out the emails that have been found into an excel file.
